# Todo #007: Tiled Background and Character Sprites

**Status**: Open
**Priority**: P2 - Medium

## Problem

Game currently uses basic deck of cards API. Should use proper Dragon Quest themed sprites.

## Tasks

- [ ] Create or find sprite sheet for Dragon Quest themed cards
- [ ] Create tiled background for dungeon grid
- [ ] Sprites for different characters:
  - [ ] Slimes
  - [ ] Skeletons
  - [ ] Trolls
  - [ ] Young Dragon
  - [ ] Dragon Queen
- [ ] Resource card sprites:
  - [ ] Gems
  - [ ] Treasure chests
  - [ ] Healing fountains
  - [ ] Secret passages
- [ ] Special card sprites:
  - [ ] Exit
  - [ ] Merchant
  - [ ] Generous Wizard
- [ ] Pit trap sprites (hidden vs visible)

## Considerations

- Should maintain retro Dragon Quest aesthetic
- Need to consider licensing/copyright
- Sprites should work at various sizes
- Consider mobile display sizes
- Animation frames if adding card flip animations

## Alternative

Continue using Deck of Cards API with custom CSS styling to make it more thematic.
