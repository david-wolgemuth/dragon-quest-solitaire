# Visual Sprites and Tiled Backgrounds

Game currently uses basic deck of cards API. Should use proper Dragon Quest themed sprites.

## Assets Needed

### Characters
- Slimes
- Skeletons
- Trolls
- Young Dragon
- Dragon Queen

### Resources
- Gems
- Treasure chests
- Healing fountains
- Secret passages

### Special
- Exit
- Merchant
- Generous Wizard

### Environment
- Tiled background for dungeon grid
- Pit trap sprites (hidden vs visible)

## Considerations

- Maintain retro Dragon Quest aesthetic
- Licensing/copyright considerations
- Sprites should work at various sizes
- Consider mobile display sizes
- Animation frames if adding card flip animations

## Alternative

Continue using Deck of Cards API with custom CSS styling to make it more thematic.
